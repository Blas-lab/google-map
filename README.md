# Google Maps

### Description

This project involves conducting a market analysis in the United States for a client who is part of a conglomerate of restaurant and related businesses. The goal is to analyze the opinions of users on Google Maps regarding hotels, restaurants, and other tourism-related businesses. The project involves collecting, cleaning and making available the data, conducting a significant analysis using machine learning techniques, and making recommendations based on the findings. The data will be extracted from the Google Maps review platform in the US and may include information about the location, category, average scores, and reviews made by users. Additional data sources may be used to complement the analysis, such as stock quotes and trends in social media and the media. The project may also involve improving marketing strategies and creating recommendation systems for specific locations such as restaurants and hotels

### The step by step pipeline for the Google Maps Reviews and Recommendations project could be:

1. Data Collection: Collect data from Google Maps platform in the United States and any additional relevant datasets.

2. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: Clean and pre-process the collected data to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, and irrelevant information.

3. Data Warehousing: Store the cleaned and pre-processed data in a data warehouse that can run locally or on a cloud-based provider.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the data to identify any relationships between variables and determine relevant information.

5. Sentiment Analysis: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process the information from the reviews and perform sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of the reviews.

6. Machine Learning Model Development: Train and develop a machine learning model using either unsupervised or supervised classification techniques to address the project goals.

7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in production to provide recommendations to users and make predictions about business growth or decline.

8. Results and Conclusion: Evaluate the results of the deployed model and draw conclusions based on the findings.

9. Improvement and Optimization: Continuously monitor the results and optimize the model based on performance and data availability.
